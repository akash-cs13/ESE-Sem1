# ESE - Semester Project - Team 5
# Roles and Responsibilities
Team together: brainstormed together the use cases.
Krithika P: Deriving requirements diagram, Context diagram, block diagram, activity diagram and fault tree analysis. 
            Worked on inspection of internal block diagram, parametric constraints and code.
            
Madhukar D: Worked on sequence diagrams, allocation diagrams, internal block diagram, parametric constraint diagram.

Akhil N   : Worked on state machine diagram and implementation on wokwi.

Akash C   : Worked on scheduling simulation and unit testing.
            Worked on inspection of fault tree analysis.
            
Team together worked collaboratively in writing the paper.
